## Complete this course in a fun, interactive way

Each course has chapters. Each chapter has lessons. Each lesson has steps. Each step has a challenge and a solution. In order to solve a step's challenge, you will have to read open source code, read the relevant docs and do the necessary research on your own. If you are stuck, there is a solution available.

This approach provides a direction to completing a course. You can save your progress and execute tests locally in your CLI.
